# dsa_style_small_spacebars
A collection of 3D models of sub 2 unit convex spacebars made with DSA profile and alike in mind. Contains .step and .stl files.

After being annoyed by my thumbs getting annihilated by the tops of smaller DSA keys, I have decided to ease my pain a little bit.
The result are 7 models of <2U spacebars, 1.25-1.75U having both veritical and horizontal versions.
